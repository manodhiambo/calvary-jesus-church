                  Our Story
                </h2>
                <div className="prose prose-lg text-slate-600 space-y-6">
                  <p>
                    Calvary Jesus Church is based on Biblical doctrine solely. We believe that the Bible is complete 
                    on its own and nothing exists outside the Bible claimed to be from God is true.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Our faith is based on the fact that, "Long ago, at many times and in many ways, God spoke to our 
                    fathers by the prophets, but in these last days, He has spoken to us by His Son, Whom He appointed 
                    the Heir of all things, through whom also, He created the world" (Hebrews 1:1-2).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Prophets and Apostles, after laying the foundation, we now build on it. This means that the 
                    only way God can communicate is through the Bible and not through dreams, visions, etc. This gives 
                    us the reasons to rely solely on the Bible and hence the reason to study the Bible.
